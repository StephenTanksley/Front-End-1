## Install

#

## Usage
`npm start` or `yarn start` 

#

## Project Name
Ride For Life

#

## Pitch
_Ride For Life_ serves mothers in Uganda to improve maternal and child survival. One of the biggest obstacles women face while pregnant is getting to a health facility to safely deliver. Most people do not own a car or a motorcycle, and a majority live greater than 5 km from a health center (an hour by foot). _Ride For Life_ provides a solution by quickly dispatching motorcycle ambulances to women in need of urgent medical care.
